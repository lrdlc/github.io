>&quot; Creativity takes courage.&quot;
><small><cite title="Matisse">Matisse</cite></small>

Welcome to The Blue Lark blog! After a month of planning, taking pictures,
thiking, and
overthinking, I finally decided to
start blogging. It takes the right amount of courage, passion and consistency!

This blog is about creativity---the fuel of imagination. You will read about
crafting, sewing, fashion,  photography, painting... but not baking cakes, this is not my
thing :D. I love handmade items, expecially colorful and bright jewerly. My favorite technique is
micromacramé---the art of interlacing cords and beads. 
Here you can find some examples of micromacramé works (the red earrings are
made by me :D).

I want to share with you my all time favourite projects, and I will try to
teach you the basis of this amazing technique. But be aware, it takes time and
patience, so don't give up at the first attempt!! I will suggest you some
places (online and not) where you can find the supplies you need to make beautiful projects
(when I was a beginner I was struggling to find the right material :S).
I want also to discover and learn new techniques from you, and keep track of my
progress---I am looking forward to read all your comments. I hope to see you
again in this blog!
