Today I want to show you the new items I purchased in the website  
<a href="https://www.perlesandco.com/">Perles&Co</a> to make some new earrings
with the technique called _needle tatting_ (_chiacchierino ad ago_ in italian,
_frivolité_ in french). Have you ever heard about this technique? 

These are the earrings that I made today :D!!

As you can see the technique allows to make fine, lightweight and detailed works of small size (compare the earring with my hand, which is very tiny! :D).

If you are interested in learining this technique, I recommend the youtube
videos by 24atp (you can find the first lesson 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPpR7lQMufQ">here</a>). 
These videos are in italian, if you are interested I can make a photo tutorial
or write a post about the needle tatting basics. Just leave a comment!

Review
------

This is my opinion on the material

* **Lizbeth cotton size 40 in Charcoal:** this thread is super high-quality.
  Cotton thread usually opens apart while you work it, but this one tolerates the handwork and the needlework really well. Note that the real color
  is lighter than the color shown in the shop picture. I am really satisfied
  because that was exactly what I was I looking for. The only downside is that
  it is pricey. **Rating:4.5/5**

* **Seed beads Myuki 15/0 in Luminous Ocean Blue:** Myuki seed beads are
  high-quality: their peculiarity is that all the beads are exactly equals in colors and shape. This makes the work very regular and precise, 
  I highly recommend to use these kind of beads to
  give an high-end finish to your works. You can also go up one size  if you
  like the beads to show up more. **Rating:5/5**

* **Fire Polished faceted round beads 3mm Chalkwhite Blue Ceramic Look** I love
  the ceramic finish of these faceted beads, and they complemented well the
  transparent look of the seed beads. I think I will use them a lot for my
  earrings. Plus: it's cheap! **Rating:5/5**


I hope you enjoyed this post! I see you soon in my blog! :D
