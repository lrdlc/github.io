The Blue Lark is a project started in August 2016,
with the support of my family and friends. 

This blog is a place where I can express myself as an handcrafter. 
 Playing with 
colors, threads, and beads makes me feel like  a child again :D. 
I hope to
meet other handcrafters like me and to share our experience.

Being a blogger and a handcrafter is not my full-time job: I am an engineer.
That's why I enjoyed so much building my own blog!
If you are an engineer (I am sure that my colleagues  will visit my blog
sooner or later) you will appreciate the next lines, otherwise 
you will find them just boring :). 

The original theme I used can
found at 
[github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator). I locally generated my blog
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The code of this blog is in my GitHub
profile [github.com/lrdlc](https://github.com/lrdlc).

I am looking forward to meeting ALL of you in The Blue Lark Blog!

Laura
